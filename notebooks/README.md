# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis and visualization.

## Purpose

Jupyter notebooks are ideal for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Step-by-step data processing
- Interactive visualizations
- Documentation with code
- Prototyping and experimentation

## Organization

Notebooks can be organized by:
- Topic (e.g., `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`, `02_visualization.ipynb`)
- Practical number (e.g., `practical_01.ipynb`)
- Project name (e.g., `sales_analysis.ipynb`)

## Running Notebooks

1. Make sure Jupyter is installed:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Navigate to this directory and open the desired notebook

## Best Practices

- Use clear cell outputs and markdown documentation
- Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks
- Export important notebooks to HTML/PDF for sharing
- Clear outputs before committing to Git (optional)

## Useful Jupyter Extensions

Consider installing:
- `jupyter contrib nbextensions` for additional features
- `jupyterlab` for a modern IDE-like interface
