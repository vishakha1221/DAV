# Projects

This directory contains major course projects that combine multiple concepts from the practicals.

## Structure

Each project should be in its own subdirectory:

```
project_name/
├── README.md          # Project description and objectives
├── data/             # Project-specific datasets
├── src/              # Source code
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── reports/          # Project reports and presentations
└── requirements.txt  # Project-specific dependencies
```

## Project Guidelines

1. **Clear Objectives**: Define what you're trying to achieve
2. **Data Sources**: Document where data comes from
3. **Methodology**: Explain your approach and techniques used
4. **Results**: Present findings with visualizations
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation

## Example Projects

Projects may include:
- Comprehensive data analysis of real-world datasets
- Interactive dashboards for data exploration
- Predictive modeling with visualization
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Comparative studies using multiple visualization techniques

## Getting Started

Each project directory will have its own README with specific setup and running instructions.
